    "## Introduction to Algorithmic Collusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) is an antitrust authority. Its primary goal is to ensure fair competition and protect consumers from anticompetitive practices. With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, a new challenge has emerged: algorithmic collusion. This phenomenon occurs when algorithms, designed to optimize pricing strategies, inadvertently or deliberately engage in collusive behaviour, leading to supra-competitive prices. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding Algorithmic Collusion\n",
    "Algorithmic collusion refers to the situation where pricing algorithms, often used by companies to set prices dynamically, result in higher prices than in traditional competition. Unlike human collusion, where firms explicitly agree to fix prices, algorithmic collusion can occur without any direct communication between firms. Instead, it arises from the algorithms' learning processes and their responses to market conditions. \n",
    "The outcomes of theoretical simulations of early studies reported in e.g. Calvano et al. (2020) and Klein (2021) have generated algorithmic collusion. Recently, Xavier Lambin  and co-authors have challenged these results and attributed algorithmic collusion to the simultaneous setup of the simulations, see e.g. Abada and Lambin (2023) and Lambin (2024). In these assignment we are going to use a simplified market to test these results and show when algorithmic collusion appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concerns\n",
    "1.\tSimultaneous Experimentation: Algorithms often experiment with different pricing strategies simultaneously. This can lead to high prices as they learn from each other's actions.\n",
    "2.\tLearning Inertia: Reinforcement learning algorithms may exhibit inertia, where initial high prices persist over time due to the learning process.\n",
    "3.\tMemoryless Environments: Even in environments where algorithms do not consider past actions, high prices can still emerge.\n",
    "Policy Implications\n",
    "Traditional antitrust measures may not be sufficient to address algorithmic collusion. Reducing market transparency, for example, may not effectively lower prices. Instead, the ACM needs to consider new approaches, such as enforcing sequential learning, where algorithms take turns exploring pricing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "ME case: Running Simulations\n",
    "To better understand algorithmic collusion, the ACM has hired you as a consultant to run simulations. Here’s a step-by-step guide:\n",
    "1.\tSet Up the Environment: Use a programming language like R or Python (and libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib).\n",
    "2.\tDefine the Market: Set up a market with two firms, each using a Q-learning algorithm. You may consider either homogeneous or differentiated products, competition in either prices (Bertrand) or quantities (Cournot) and whether prices are set either simultaneously (Lambin, 2024) or sequentially (Klein, 2021). One combination suffices.\n",
    "3.\tImplement Q-Learning: Create a Q-learning algorithm that simulates decisions in your duopoly market.\n",
    "4.\tRun Simulations: Allow the algorithms to explore and exploit strategies over multiple iterations similar as in the literature.\n",
    "5.\tAnalyse Results: Observe whether the algorithms converge to high prices and compare the results to the findings in the literature.\n",
    "6.\tPolicy Recommendations: Use your simulations to report to the ACM whether algorithmic collusion is a threat (or not). It would be nice to calculate welfare effects, such as the gain in producer surplus, the loss of consumer surplus and the deadweight loss.   \n",
    "By running these simulations, you gain hands-on experience with the dynamics of algorithmic collusion and explore potential policy interventions to mitigate its effects.\n"
